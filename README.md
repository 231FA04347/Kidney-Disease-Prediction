## Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques based on patient health data. The goal is to assist early diagnosis and improve clinical outcomes using predictive analytics.

## Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing of medical datasets
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Model building using classification algorithms
* Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA)
* Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)
* Google Colab

## Algorithms Implemented

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Outcomes

* Trained and tested models to predict CKD
* Identified most accurate algorithm based on evaluation metrics

## Dataset

Used a publicly available kidney disease dataset containing medical attributes like blood pressure, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, etc.
